# This function is to produce a blank plot that has 
# the proper axes labels, background color, etc.
# It is to be used for both the top and bottom plot.

# The parameters are
# xlim is a two element numeric vector used for the two
# end points of the x axis
# ylim is the same as xlim, but for the y axis
# ylabels is a numeric vector of labels for "tick marks"
# on the y axis
# We don't need to x labels because they are Month names
# margins specifies the size of the plot margins (see mar parameter in par)
# cityName is a character string to use in the title
# xtop indicates whether the month names are to appear
# at the top of the plot or the bottom of the plot
# 
# See the assignment for a pdf image of the plot that is
# produced as a result of calling this function.
